## For families across the Middle East and Africa

This hands-on science program is offered by IBM Research and has been developed by IBM scientists who believe that science should be fun! These sessions have been taught for 30 years and we are excited to bring them to Africa and the Middle East!
The IBM instructors worked hard to turn the classes into a virtual interactive session, covering a series of topics. 

During these sessions, the scientists engage with the students and the students can ask questions as well. We encourage parents or teachers to join the sessions along with the students, but it is not a requirement. These classes are recorded in case a student is not able to join on the date/time we offer a specific topic. Each session will be approximately 90 mins long and further program details are provided in the table below. You are welcome to join the sessions up to 15 minutes before the start time to ensure good connectivity.

Stayed tuned for details on the 2025 IBM Family Science Africa Program!

| 22 July 2023 | 11:00 AM (13:00 PM SAST) | <h4>Why science is important for girls and boys</h4> Explore the opportunity to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering and Math - talk to some of our scientists about what inspired them, how they got started and what they love about their jobs.|
| 29 July 2023 | 11:00 AM (13:00 PM SAST) | <h4>Computers, programming, and robotics</h4> In these classes you will learn how computers are made and how they work on the inside. Learn about coding fundamentals and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the world. |
| 5 August 2023 | 11:00 AM (13:00 PM SAST) | <h4>Kitchen chemistry</h4>Learn about the periodic table, states of matter and have fun experimenting in the kitchen!|
| 12 August 2023 | 11:00 AM (13:00 PM SAST) | <h4>Waves and quantum</h4> This introduction to waves will help you understand how standing waves shape the world around us. Classical physics is what we experience in our everyday lives. If you were to shrink down to the subatomic world - this is the domain of quantum physics.|
