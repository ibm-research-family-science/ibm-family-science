Below are links to handouts describing what is covered in the Family Science Saturdays classes. We encourage you to read the handouts to learn more about each experiment and we hope you repeat and further explore many of them at home with your siblings and friends, or at school with your classmates. Many of the experiments also make great party tricks, hint hint. Please feel free to make copies of these handouts / worksheets or distribute them electronically.
