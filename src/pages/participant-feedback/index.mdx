> Honestly, it was just awesome. I loved seeing my daughter learn all this science, having detailed questions and answers and beyond that, just creating this opportunity to know what we had to prepare and getting it done ahead of time just made this awesome! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!


> "SO MUCH FUN! My 9 year old son, whose attention is tough to maintain, was engaged almost the entire session. He loved crushing the fruit and extracting the polymers, as well as typing in answers to questions."


> “It was an exciting way to engage families in learning something.”

> "The pace of the class was perfect, and the real life examples really helped explain the concepts. Well done!"

> "There was always something the children could relate to while abstract concepts were being presented to them in a very clear and simplified way - good slide deck and great instructor!"

> “Overall excellent and thank you for organizing and selecting such wonderful topics.”

> “Easy and clear facilitation of the topic, with practical examples. It was fun learning.”

> “It was easy for children to follow the course”


> "My kids had a great time. And actually learned something in the process."

> “The Algorithms session was excellent. My kids enjoyed and learned. BTW, we did not have access to a printer, but my kids just traced the maps in advance to be ready for the session, and it worked great.”

> “My child's favorite exercise was the maps, mine was Codes and Probability. Thank you for facilitating this activity, we had fun.”

> "Thank you very much for this session! We are from the Israeli lab, so these remote sessions are my son's only opportunity to participate in the wonderful sessions of Family Science."

> "My son had no experience with Python or coding, however, he was so interested and focused during the class, he even kept practicing after the class and kept adding new scripts to try new things."
