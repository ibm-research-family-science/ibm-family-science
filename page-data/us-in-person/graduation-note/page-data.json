We hope you had fun learning with the IBM Family Science team.  This program gave you the opportunity to meet with real scientists, engineers and mathematicians as they led the sessions. \nThis page will also be posted on our website  https://ibm.biz/familyscience so you can click on the links.  Please see US – In Person Program, and select Graduation Note.\n\nIf you enjoyed these sessions, we hope you keep learning about science and technology: \n- When you go on family vacations, visit a science museum in that location\n-\tSign up for STEM camps, if your school has them\n-\tJoin your school’s robotics efforts.  To learn more about Robotics, consider FIRST LEGO LEAGUE (FLL).  It is a competition for kids 9 to 16 years old - to learn to work as a team while finding solutions to real life problems and programming a robot to complete missions\nhttps://www.firstlegoleague.org/ \n-\tSee additional activities and websites below\n\nWe need more engineers and scientists.  We encourage parents to support their students’ interests in developing their abilities in science.  \n\n**CERTIFICATES** <br/>\nWe have provided a certificate to honor the students for taking these classes\n\n**ABOUT IBM RESEARCH** <br/>\nIBM Research is one of the largest industrial research organizations in the world, with 12 labs in 6 continents.  IBM employees have won 6 Nobel Prizes, 6 Turing Awards, 20 inductees into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame, 19 National Medals of Technology, 5 National Medals of Science and 3 Kavli Prizes.  IBM has been the leader in patents for over 26 years, many of them originating in Research.  Inventions you may be familiar with are ATMs, UPC bar codes and Lasik surgery.  Our scientists are charting the future of artificial intelligence and breakthroughs like quantum computing.\n\n**ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES AND WEBSITES (These are non-IBM sites)**\n1.\tThe New York Hall of Science (NYSCI) https://nysci.org/\nbrings the best of their hands-on science learning resources to families via the internet.
